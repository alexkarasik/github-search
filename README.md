## General Approach
One of the good things about doing a full stack project is the ability to go back and forth between

## Technologies Used
This is a full stack application made with Ruby and Ember. In my experience making this application, Ember has some ups and downs in terms of its ease of use. The ideas behind routing and the flow of data connect with me, but I was trying to do some things with it that were very new to me and caused me some trouble.
I realized how similair Rails and Ember are to each other in many ways and I definitely see how Ember can make some parts of the process easier. Frameworks can be very helpful, but they have a learning curve and I would definitely give myself some more time in the future to implement.

## Unsolved Problems
I want to add comments to these Repositories that users add to their Favorites list and have users be able to edit and delete these comments. I think this will be relaticely easy to do after some of my experiences on this project and my past experience with this kind of CRUDing in previous projects.
